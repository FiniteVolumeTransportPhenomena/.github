# The FiniteVolumeTransportPhenomena Organization on GitHub

This is an informal GitHub organization around the finite volume method (FVM) for numerical modeling of (simple) transport phenomena and the software tools that enable this. Compared to finite differences and finite elements, FVM is the more "physical" numerical method, as it is directly linked to the conservation of mass and energy. It is also close to the idea of control volumes in open systems thermodynamics.

The present focus is on the numerical modeling of advection-diffusion-reaction systems in simple (regular grid) geometries for the frequent cases where the flow velocity field is already known. The field of computational fluid dynamics, for which many finite-volume codes and educational resources exist elsewhere, is not covered. 

Of particular interest are simple FVM tools and research codes which illustrate how the finite-volume method works (*e.g.,* one can see how the matrix equations are constructed and how the FV solution evolves). We consider these a stepping stone to more powerful software libraries, as they provide insight how "full-featured" numerical software works on the inside. 

This organization should eventually also host repositories with educational course materials and specific research models (*e.g.*, reactive transport in porous media) using the FVM. Any help and any contributions are more than welcome: do not hesitate to contact us and become a member of the FiniteVolumeTransportPhenomena organization, so that existing resources may be centralized here.
